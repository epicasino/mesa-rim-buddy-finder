## Description

- A full-stack web application using the MERN Stack to find your next climbing buddy!
- Instead of trying to decipher people's handwriting on a tiny board (including my own), you can now view and connect with climbers on your phone or desktop!
- You can view a climber's different disciplines, climbing gyms, and their weekly availability!
